## Features of submission
* Mobile Responsive

## Coding Decisions
* Use React framework to allow instant feedback to user
* Use CSS flexbox for responsive design
* No use of CSS framework eg: Bootstrap

## Challenges
* I had never seen the vCard format before so I had to do some learning to understand the requirements.
* Creating a reponsive app without using a CSS framework such as Bootstrap
* I dont have a version of photoshop so I would like to get the CSS to match exactly. It was a bit hard to get exact details i used my judgement to get it as close as possible without the exact specifications.
* I ran out of free trials to test for IE10 so I am not sure if its working although it works on IE11

## Further Improvements
* Use a responsive framework such as Bootstrap
* Use an image cropping package such as React-image-crop to allow resizing and cropping of images
* Get exact details of styling requirements from the designer
* Get a paid plan to test for IE10 compatibility
* Write Tests
* Run HTML validation
